consideration:

Each edge has two halfedges

edges are kept in a vector and all the edges are printed according as given through the sample input

This is same with printing Halfedges also

My implementation may not work if the last two inputs in the form (x,y) are same. This is to make the file read issue clear

faces and its edges are printed through the halfedges itteration of the Halfedges

While file reading It only reads the input points in the format x and space then Y and then next line.

Points are considered as doubles not integers (x,y) else it would make a chaos in solving.

The point given is compared with the centriod of the respective face that whether they are on same side or on different side.

There shouldn't be any reflex angles in the face we are itterating.
